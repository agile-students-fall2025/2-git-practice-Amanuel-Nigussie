## What I Find Interesting  
Scrum is an agile project management framework that helps teams deliver work in small, iterative cycles called sprints. What I find interesting from this article is how Scrum balances **structure and flexibility**: it prescribes clear roles, events, and artifacts to keep teams aligned, yet it also encourages adaptation so each team can evolve its own best practices. The discipline and adaptability is what makes Scrum uniquely powerful and widely applicable in software development.
